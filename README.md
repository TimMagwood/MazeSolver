This repository is for exploring maze solving in a variety of formats.
It is to grow my knowledge of algorithms and improve my problem solving skills.

To Do:
[x] Maze Generation
    [-] Make maze generation dynamic based on user input
    [-] Allow user to click maze to set start and end points
        [-] Mark start/end with dots
    [-] Toggle for walls as cells/borders?
[-] Maze Solving (variety of pathfinding methods)
    [-] BFS
    [-] DFS
    [-] Dijkstra
    [-] A*
    [-] Flood?
    [-] Hand-on-wall?
    [-] Hacking? Add easter egg to remove walls between start and end to solve maze via direct path.
[-] Animate Maze solving
    [-] Color cells as they are searched, then color correct path
[-] Auto-generate docs based on method header comments
